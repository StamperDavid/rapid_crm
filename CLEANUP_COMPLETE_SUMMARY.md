## Remaining Items (Optional - Low Priority)

### TODO Comments (46 found)
These are legitimate development notes, not cleanup items. Priority files:
- `src/services/schemaService.ts` - 11 TODOs
- `src/modules/CRM/pages/CompanyDetail.tsx` - 3 TODOs
- `src/modules/CRM/pages/UserManagement.tsx` - 3 TODOs

**Recommendation**: Address as part of normal development, not urgent

### Empty Directories
May have been removed during cleanup:
- `src/middleware/` - Check if still empty
- `src/schemas/` - Check if still empty

**Recommendation**: Leave for now, may be used in future
