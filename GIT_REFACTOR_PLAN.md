# Git Refactor Plan - Remove ELD/IFTA/SEO/Video Modules

## Strategy: Create Backup Branch Before Major Refactor

### Phase 1: Create Backup Branch (NOW)

This preserves the complete feature set before removal.

```bash
# Create and switch to backup branch
git checkout -b archive/full-feature-set-v1.0

# Stage all current changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "archive: Complete feature set including ELD, IFTA, SEO, Video modules

This commit preserves the full-featured version of Rapid CRM including:

Features included in this archive:
- ELD (Electronic Logging Device) compliance module
  - HOS logging and DVIR management
  - Client onboarding and compliance reporting
  - 8 service files, 8 components, Python integration
  
- IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement) module
  - Quarterly filing and fuel tax calculation
  - Multi-state compliance tracking
  - 4 service files, 2 components
  
- SEO Automation module
  - Competitor analysis and content opportunities
  - Automated SEO recommendations
  - 8 service files, dedicated AI agent
  
- Video Production Suite
  - AI video generation and CGI engine
  - Character creation and post-production
  - 9 components, 3 service files

Archive Metadata:
- Total files: ~85 feature-specific files
- Database tables: 40+ additional tables
- API routes: ~250 lines in server.js
- Business model: ELD compliance SaaS platform
- MVP focus: Transportation compliance services

Reason for archival:
Refocusing business model on core USDOT registration and compliance
agency services. These modules represent valuable IP that may be
reactivated as separate products or service add-ons in the future.

Restoration: To restore these features, cherry-pick from this branch
or merge the entire branch back into main.

Date: October 14, 2025
Last working state: Confirmed operational
Dependencies: See package.json for module-specific requirements"

# Push backup branch to remote
git push -u origin archive/full-feature-set-v1.0
```

### Phase 2: Return to Main Branch

```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Confirm you're on main
git branch
```

### Phase 3: Create Feature Removal Commits

Use semantic commit messages following Conventional Commits format.

#### Commit 1: Remove Video Production Module
```bash
# Remove video files
rm -rf src/components/video
rm -rf src/services/video
rm src/pages/VideoProductionDashboard.tsx

# Commit with breaking change notation
git add .
git commit -m "refactor!: Remove video production module

BREAKING CHANGE: Video production features removed from core platform

Removed components:
- src/components/video/* (9 components)
- src/services/video/* (3 services)
- src/pages/VideoProductionDashboard.tsx
- API routes: /api/video/*

Reason: Refocusing on core USDOT compliance business. Video production
is not part of the core value proposition and adds unnecessary complexity.

Impact:
- Reduces codebase by ~15 files
- Removes video creation API endpoints
- Simplifies navigation and user experience

Recovery: Available in archive/full-feature-set-v1.0 branch

Co-dependencies: None - module was isolated"
```

#### Commit 2: Remove SEO Automation Module
```bash
# Remove SEO files
rm -rf src/services/seo
rm -rf src/services/ai/SEOAutomationAgent*
rm src/database/seo_automation_schema.sql
rm src/pages/SEODashboard.tsx

git add .
git commit -m "refactor!: Remove SEO automation module

BREAKING CHANGE: SEO automation and competitive intelligence features removed

Removed components:
- src/services/seo/* (8 services)
- src/services/ai/SEOAutomationAgent* (AI agent + routes)
- src/database/seo_automation_schema.sql
- src/pages/SEODashboard.tsx
- API routes: /api/seo/*, /api/seo-agent/*

Reason: SEO automation is a marketing tool, not core to the USDOT
compliance agency business model. Can be reactivated later as an
internal tool if needed.

Impact:
- Reduces codebase by ~15 files
- Removes 5 database tables (seo_competitors, seo_metrics, etc.)
- Removes SEO-related API endpoints
- No impact on core CRM or compliance workflows

Recovery: Available in archive/full-feature-set-v1.0 branch

Co-dependencies: None - module was isolated"
```

#### Commit 3: Remove IFTA Module
```bash
# Remove IFTA files
rm -rf src/components/ifta
rm -rf src/services/ifta
rm src/database/ifta_schema.sql
rm src/database/minimal_ifta_init.js
rm src/pages/IFTADashboard.tsx

git add .
git commit -m "refactor!: Remove IFTA compliance module

BREAKING CHANGE: IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement) features removed

Removed components:
- src/components/ifta/* (2 components)
- src/services/ifta/* (4 services)
- src/database/ifta_schema.sql
- src/database/minimal_ifta_init.js
- src/pages/IFTADashboard.tsx
- API routes: /api/ifta/*

Reason: Pivoting from full compliance monitoring (ELD/IFTA) to focused
USDOT registration and renewal management agency model.

Impact:
- Reduces codebase by ~15 files
- Removes 6 database tables (ifta_registrations, ifta_quarterly_filings, etc.)
- Removes IFTA dashboard and reporting features
- Minor cleanup needed in EldServiceIntegration.ts (IFTA references)

Recovery: Available in archive/full-feature-set-v1.0 branch

Co-dependencies: Referenced in src/services/eld/EldServiceIntegration.ts
(lines 224-257) - requires cleanup"
```

#### Commit 4: Remove ELD Module
```bash
# Remove ELD files
rm -rf src/components/eld
rm -rf src/services/eld
rm -rf PycharmProjects/rapid_eld
rm src/database/eld_schema.sql
rm src/database/eld_service_schema.sql
rm src/database/add_eld_tables.js
rm src/database/add_eld_tables_final.js
rm src/pages/ELDDashboard.tsx

git add .
git commit -m "refactor!: Remove ELD compliance monitoring module

BREAKING CHANGE: ELD (Electronic Logging Device) compliance features removed

Removed components:
- src/components/eld/* (8 components)
- src/services/eld/* (8 services)
- src/database/eld_schema.sql + eld_service_schema.sql
- src/pages/ELDDashboard.tsx
- PycharmProjects/rapid_eld/* (entire Python module)
- API routes: /api/eld/*

Reason: Major business model pivot from ELD compliance SaaS (per MVP_README.md)
to USDOT registration and compliance agency model (per PROJECT_REFERENCE.md).
This represents a strategic refocus on core value proposition.

Impact:
- Reduces codebase by ~35 files
- Removes 10+ database tables (eld_hos_logs, eld_dvir_reports, etc.)
- Removes ELD dashboard and monitoring features
- Removes Python rapid_eld integration module
- Changes revenue model from $50-200/month ELD subscriptions to 
  USDOT registration + renewal management (70% revenue from renewals)

Recovery: Available in archive/full-feature-set-v1.0 branch

Business Model Change:
OLD: ELD compliance platform with recurring monitoring fees
NEW: USDOT registration agency with renewal management focus

Co-dependencies: None in core business logic"
```

#### Commit 5: Update Configuration and Routes
```bash
# Edit files to remove module references
# - src/App.tsx (remove routes and imports)
# - src/config/dashboardModules.ts (remove module configs)
# - server.js (remove API routes)
# - docs/agents.md (remove ELD/IFTA references)
