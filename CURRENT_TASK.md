# Current Task: USDOT RPA Agent Training Environment

**What You Want:** Training center that uses the ACTUAL USDOT RPA Agent (not a simulation)

**Current Status:** Built the agent (`USDOTFormFillerAgent.ts`) and API endpoints, but training center still has issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Clean up the training center code properly
2. Integrate actual agent calls
3. Test the full flow

**DO NOT:**
- Create separate training environments
- Build simulations
- Over-engineer

**DO:**
- Use the ONE training center at `/training/usdot`
- Call the ACTUAL agent via API  
- Display all 77 real HTML pages
- Let you review and correct the agent's decisions

**Pausing here - will resume when user is ready to test or requests next steps.**
