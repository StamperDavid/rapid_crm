**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ACTUAL AGENT TRAINING (Not Simulation)

---

## üéØ What This Is

**A training environment for the ACTUAL USDOT RPA AI agent.**

Just like Alex Training Center trains Alex, this trains the USDOT Form Filler Agent.

---

## ü§ñ The Actual Agent

**File:** `src/services/rpa/USDOTFormFillerAgent.ts`

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes scenario data (company info, fleet, operations)
- Makes intelligent decisions about what value goes in each of 177 form fields
- Provides reasoning for each decision
- Learns from your corrections
- Improves accuracy over time

**NOT a simulation** - This is the real AI that will eventually file actual USDOT applications.

## üîÑ Training Workflow

### 1. Load Scenario
- One of 918 scenarios from database
- Contains complete company data

### 2. Agent Analyzes
- **Actual RPA agent** (`USDOTFormFillerAgent`) receives scenario
- Agent decides what to fill in each field across all 77 pages
- Agent provides reasoning for each decision

### 3. Visual Display
- Training center shows agent filling forms page by page
- You see what the agent decided for each field
- Fields highlight as they're filled

### 4. Review
- Go through pages 1-77
- See what agent filled on each page
- Mark fields as correct or incorrect
- Provide detailed corrections

### 5. Agent Learns
- Corrections sent to agent via API
- Agent stores corrections in knowledge base
- Agent improves on next scenario

## üöÄ How To Train

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/training/usdot`
2. Click "Load Scenario & Start Training"
3. Click "Watch RPA Auto-Fill"
4. **Actual agent analyzes scenario** and fills all fields
5. Navigate through pages to see what agent filled
6. Mark fields correct/incorrect
7. Provide detailed correction feedback
8. Submit - agent learns from your feedback
9. Next scenario

---

## üß† What The Agent Learns

- Correct field mappings (scenario data ‚Üí form field IDs)
- Business logic (e.g., "if interstate, split drivers 30/70")
- Edge cases (e.g., "email should be exact match, not modified")
- Regulatory rules (e.g., "property carriers always answer Yes to transport property")

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Agent is ready for production when:
- 95%+ accuracy across all 918 scenarios
- Consistent reasoning in decisions
- No recurring mistakes
- Handles all 177 form fields correctly
