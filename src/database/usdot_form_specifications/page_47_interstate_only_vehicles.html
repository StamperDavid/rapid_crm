Progress: Still at 32%

PAGE TITLE ROW HIDDEN:
Notice that the leafPageTitleTR has style="display: none;" - no visible page title.

DUAL TOOLTIPS:
This page has TWO separate tooltips in the question text:
1. "Commercial Motor Vehicles" - Full CMV definition (4 criteria)
2. "Interstate" - Definition of interstate commerce (cross state lines OR through movement)

INTERSTATE DEFINITION (from tooltip):
"Transportation of passengers or property:
(1) across State lines, including international boundaries; or
(2) within one State as part of a through movement that originates or terminates in another State or country."

KEY DISTINCTION:
"Solely in Interstate Commerce" = ONLY interstate, no intrastate operations
This is different from:
- Page 46: Canada/Mexico international operations
- Page 34: Question about WHETHER they do interstate (Yes/No)
This asks HOW MANY vehicles operate EXCLUSIVELY interstate

FIELD DETAILS:
- Single numeric input
- maxlength="5", size="5", width="100px"
- aria-required="false" (optional field)

TOTAL FIELDS: 1 numeric input (optional)
