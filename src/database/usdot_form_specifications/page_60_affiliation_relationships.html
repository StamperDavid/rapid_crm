CRITICAL 3-YEAR LOOKBACK PERIOD!
"currently have, or has had within the last 3 years"

TYPES OF AFFILIATIONS COVERED:
1. Common Stock - Shared equity ownership
2. Common Ownership - Same owners/shareholders
3. Common Management - Shared executives/managers
4. Common Control - Same decision-makers
5. Familial Relationships - Family ties between entities
6. "any other person or applicant for registration" - catch-all

REGULATORY PURPOSE:
FMCSA tracks affiliations to:
- Prevent carriers from evading safety enforcement through shell companies
- Identify corporate families with shared liability exposure
- Track safety performance across related entities
- Prevent DOT number "churning" (closing bad carrier, reopening as new)
- Enforce out-of-service orders against affiliated companies

49 CFR 390.5 AFFILIATION DEFINITION:
Companies are affiliated when they have:
- Common ownership (family or corporate)
- Common control (shared decision-making)
- Common management (same officers/directors)

BRANCHING LOGIC:
- YES → Will likely ask for:
  - USDOT/MC numbers of affiliated entities
  - Nature of relationship
  - Dates of affiliation
  - Contact information for affiliated companies
- NO → Skip affiliation detail pages
