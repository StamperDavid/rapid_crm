                      As an applicant applying for operating authority, you will be required to have specific 
                      insurance and legal process agent (Form BOC-3) documents on file before FMCSA will issue 
                      authority. Your application will be dismissed if you fail to have your insurance and BOC-3 
                      submitted within 90 days from the file date of your application. The required insurance 
                      filings vary, based on the types of registrations involved. For information on which insurance 
                      filings are required for your operations,

                    <p>
                      <strong>Please note:</strong> A dismissal is the equivalent of a rejection and the only cure 
                      is either (1) an appeal, because you have evidence that insurance was actually filed, or 
                      (2) to file a new application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In addition to Federal requirements, all applicants must comply with registration, fuel tax, 
                      and other State regulations and procedures. Before beginning new or expanded interstate 
                      operations, applicants must familiarize themselves with the various State rules applicable 
                      to interstate companies in each State in which they plan to operate. Begin this process by 
                      contacting the transportation regulatory agency for the State in which the applicant is located.
