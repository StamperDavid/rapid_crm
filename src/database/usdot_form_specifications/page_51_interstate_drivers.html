<!-- METADATA -->
<!--
Form ID: form_B0071P070021
Branch: B007 (Drivers)
Page: P070021
Section: S07002
Questions: Q07011 (main), Q07001 (within 100), Q07002 (beyond 100)
Progress: Still at 36%

PAGE TITLE ROW HIDDEN:
Notice that the leafPageTitleTR has style="display: none;" - no visible page title.

100 AIR-MILE RADIUS SIGNIFICANCE:
This is a critical regulatory distinction for Hours of Service (HOS) requirements:

- WITHIN 100 Air-Mile Radius: Simplified HOS rules
  - Drivers who operate within 100 air-miles of their normal work reporting location
  - May use time records instead of logs
  - Extended duty period (14 hours)
  - Exemptions from electronic logging device (ELD) if meet conditions

- BEYOND 100 Air-Mile Radius: Full HOS rules
  - Drivers who travel more than 100 air-miles from base
  - Required to keep logs (Records of Duty Status)
  - Standard duty period (11 hours driving, 14 hours on-duty)
  - ELD mandate typically applies

INTERSTATE DEFINITION (from tooltip):
"The driver transports passengers or property:
(1) across State lines, including international boundaries; or
(2) entirely within one State as part of a through movement that originates or terminates in another State or country."

FIELD DETAILS:
- Both fields: maxlength="5", size="5", width="100px"
- aria-required="false" (optional fields)
- Numeric inputs

REGULATORY CONTEXT:
This categorization helps FMCSA understand:
1. How many drivers need full ELD compliance
2. Which drivers qualify for HOS exemptions
3. Inspection/compliance priorities

TOTAL FIELDS: 2 numeric inputs (optional)
