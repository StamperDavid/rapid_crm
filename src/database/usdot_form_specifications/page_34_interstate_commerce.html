CRITICAL DISTINCTION - INTERSTATE vs INTRASTATE:

TOOLTIP DEFINITION (with HTML formatting):
"Transportation of passengers or property:
(1) across State lines, including international boundaries; or
(2) within one State as part of a through movement that originates or terminates in another State or country."

INTERSTATE COMMERCE INCLUDES:
1. Movement across state lines (e.g., California to Nevada)
2. Movement across international boundaries (e.g., US to Canada/Mexico)
3. Movement WITHIN one state as part of interstate journey
   - Example: Pick up in Chicago, drive through Illinois to Indiana
   - The Illinois portion is still interstate commerce

INTRASTATE COMMERCE:
- Movement entirely within one state
- Not part of any interstate movement
- Subject to STATE regulations only (not federal FMCSA)

REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS:

YES (Interstate):
- Subject to FMCSA federal regulations
- Requires USDOT Number
- Must comply with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs)
- Interstate insurance requirements
- Hours of Service federal rules apply

NO (Intrastate only):
- May not need USDOT Number (depends on cargo/weight)
- Subject to state-level regulations
- State insurance requirements
- State-specific hours of service rules

Note: Question specifies "Non-Hazardous Materials"
- Hazardous materials have different rules (always require USDOT number)
- This question is specifically for non-hazmat interstate determination

This is a CRITICAL question that determines:
1. Federal vs state jurisdiction
2. USDOT Number requirement for non-hazmat carriers
3. Which regulations apply
4. Insurance requirements

For RPA training, must understand:
- Even partial interstate travel = Interstate commerce
- Through movements count as interstate
- International = Interstate
