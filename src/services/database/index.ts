// Main database exports - REMOVED to prevent direct database access
// All database operations should go through API endpoints
// export { DatabaseManager, databaseManager } from './DatabaseManager';
// export { DatabaseService, databaseService } from './DatabaseService';

// All database services have been removed to use only the main rapid_crm.db
// through direct API endpoints. No separate database services should be used.
