# Alex Training Center - Complete Guide

## üéØ What Was Built

A comprehensive training system for the Alex onboarding agent that allows you to manually train Alex with real USDOT application scenarios and provide corrections that both Alex and Jasper learn from.

---

## üì¶ Components Created

### 1. **Scenario Generator** (`src/services/training/ScenarioGenerator.ts`)
- Generates ~2,400+ complete USDOT application scenarios
- Each scenario includes ALL USDOT questions with realistic answers:
  - Company information
  - Business structure
  - Operation classification (for-hire vs private, interstate vs intrastate)
  - Vehicle fleet details
  - Driver information
  - Cargo types
  - Expected correct regulatory requirements

### 2. **Database Schema** (`src/database/alex_training_schema.sql`)
- **alex_training_scenarios** - Stores all generated scenarios
- **alex_test_results** - Alex's responses to each scenario
- **alex_training_sessions** - Groups tests into training sessions with stats
- **shared_regulatory_knowledge** - Knowledge base shared by Alex AND Jasper
- **alex_training_corrections** - Detailed log of all your corrections
- **alex_performance_metrics** - Tracks Alex's improvement over time

### 3. **Training Service** (`src/services/training/AlexTrainingService.ts`)
- Manages scenario generation and storage
- Tests Alex with scenarios
- Processes your feedback and corrections
- Updates shared knowledge base
- Tracks performance metrics

### 4. **Training UI** (`src/components/training/AlexTrainingCenter.tsx`)
- **Split-screen interface**:
  - Left panel: Complete scenario details (what client submitted)
  - Right panel: Alex's determination and reasoning
  - Bottom panel: Your feedback/correction window
- Generate scenarios once, store permanently
- Test scenarios in random order
- Mark responses as correct/incorrect
- Provide detailed corrections

### 5. **API Endpoints** (added to `server.js`)
- `GET /api/alex-training/session` - Get current training session
- `POST /api/alex-training/generate-scenarios` - Generate all scenarios
- `GET /api/alex-training/next-scenario` - Get next random scenario
- `POST /api/alex-training/test-scenario` - Test Alex with scenario
- `POST /api/alex-training/submit-feedback` - Submit your review/correction

## üöÄ How To Use

### Step 1: Access Training Center
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to: **`http://localhost:3000/training/alex`**

### Step 2: Generate Scenarios (One-Time)
1. Click "Generate Training Scenarios"
2. System creates ~2,400 complete USDOT applications
3. Scenarios are stored permanently in database

### Step 3: Train Alex
1. Click "Start Training" or "Next Scenario"
2. Review the scenario details on the left
3. See Alex's determination on the right
4. Check if Alex got it correct:
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmarks = correct requirements
   - ‚ùå Red X marks = incorrect requirements

### Step 4: Provide Feedback
1. In the feedback box, explain:
   - What Alex got right/wrong
   - Why it's correct/incorrect
   - What the correct answer should be
2. Click "Mark Correct" or "Mark Incorrect"
3. Your correction is saved to shared knowledge base
4. Both Alex AND Jasper learn from it

### Step 5: Continue Training
- System automatically loads next random scenario
- Track progress in top-right corner
- See accuracy percentage improve over time

## üéì Learning System

### How Alex Learns
1. You provide correction for incorrect answer
2. Correction saved to `shared_regulatory_knowledge` table
3. Similar future scenarios reference this knowledge
4. Alex's accuracy improves over time

### How Jasper Learns
1. Jasper has access to same `shared_regulatory_knowledge` table
2. When you correct Alex, Jasper sees the correction
3. Jasper can use this knowledge when:
   - Managing Alex
   - Answering compliance questions
   - Coordinating other future agents

### Shared Knowledge Structure
- **State-specific rules** - Different thresholds per state
- **Operation type logic** - For-hire vs private property
- **Interstate vs intrastate** - Federal vs state rules
- **Cargo-specific requirements** - Hazmat, passengers, etc.
- **Your expert explanations** - Why each rule applies

---

## üìä Performance Tracking

### Session Stats
- **Total Scenarios**: How many generated
- **Completed**: How many Alex has been tested on
- **Correct**: How many Alex got right
- **Incorrect**: How many Alex got wrong
- **Accuracy %**: Overall performance percentage

### Improvement Over Time
- System tracks accuracy trends
- Identifies common mistakes
- Shows which areas Alex struggles with
- Suggests when Alex is ready for production

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Scenario Coverage
- **51 states** (including DC)
- **4 operation types**: For-hire interstate, for-hire intrastate, private interstate, private intrastate
- **Multiple business types**: Sole proprietor, LLC, corporation, partnership
- **Various cargo types**: General freight, hazmat, household goods, passengers
- **Different fleet sizes**: Small (1-3), medium (4-10), large (11-25)
- **~2,400 total realistic scenarios**

### What Each Scenario Includes
‚úÖ All USDOT application questions answered
‚úÖ Complete company information
‚úÖ Full vehicle fleet details
‚úÖ Driver information
‚úÖ Cargo classifications
‚úÖ Expected correct regulatory determination
‚úÖ Reasoning for correct answer

### Random Testing Order
- Scenarios presented randomly (not by difficulty)
- Simulates real-world variety
- Prevents Alex from "memorizing" patterns
- Tests true understanding of regulations

## üí° Best Practices

### When Providing Corrections
1. **Be Specific**: Explain exactly what was wrong
2. **Cite Rules**: Reference specific regulations (49 CFR, qualified states list, etc.)
3. **Explain Why**: Help Alex understand the logic, not just the answer
4. **Be Consistent**: Use same terminology across corrections
5. **Add Context**: Include edge cases or special considerations

### Example Good Correction
```
"IFTA is NOT required in this scenario because the company only has 2 vehicles. 
IFTA triggers when a company has qualified motor vehicles (26,001+ lbs or 3+ axles) 
crossing state lines. While they are interstate, they don't meet the IFTA thresholds yet.
They will need IFTA if they add more vehicles or upgrade to heavier trucks."
```

### Example Bad Correction
```
"Wrong. Should be no."
```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Alex is ready for production when:
- ‚úÖ 95%+ accuracy on interstate scenarios
- ‚úÖ 90%+ accuracy on intrastate scenarios  
- ‚úÖ 100% accuracy on hazmat requirements
- ‚úÖ Consistent reasoning in explanations
- ‚úÖ No recurring mistakes in same scenario types

### Deleted Files
- `src/components/training/AlexOnboardingTrainingCenter.tsx` (old manual simulator)

## üö® Important Notes

### Interstate vs Intrastate
This is the MOST CRITICAL distinction:
- **Interstate** = Crosses state lines = Federal 49 CFR ALWAYS applies
- **Intrastate** = Within one state = Qualified States List applies

Make sure Alex understands this fundamental rule!

### Qualified States List
- For intrastate operations, each state has different thresholds
- These override federal rules
- Must be queried from `qualified_states` table
- This is where most mistakes happen

### For-Hire vs Private Property
- **For-hire** = Transporting property for compensation = Needs MC Authority
- **Private property** = Transporting own goods = No MC Authority needed
