## How Scenarios Are Generated

The `ScenarioGenerator.createScenario()` method creates **realistic, complete** scenarios:

### For-Hire Interstate Example:
```typescript

    street: "1234 Main Street",
    city: "Los Angeles",
    state: "CA",
    postalCode: "90001"
  },
  // ... ALL 79 fields populated with realistic data
  receiveCompensationForTransport: "Yes",  // For-hire
  transportNonHazardousInterstate: "Yes",   // Interstate
  vehicles: {
    straightTrucks: { owned: 3, termLeased: 0, tripLeased: 0, towDriveway: 0, serviced: 0 }
    // ... complete vehicle breakdown
  },
  driversWithCDL: 3,

## Expected Requirements (Training Validation)

Each scenario also includes **what Alex should determine**:

```typescript
expectedRequirements: {
  usdotRequired: true,
  mcAuthorityRequired: true,
  hazmatEndorsementRequired: false,
  iftaRequired: true,
  stateRegistrationRequired: false,
  reasoning: "Interstate operation: Federal 49 CFR applies. USDOT required for interstate commerce with CMVs over 10,001 lbs. MC Authority required for for-hire interstate property transport. IFTA required for interstate fuel tax reporting."
}
```

This allows the training system to **validate** if Alex correctly determines requirements!

---

## Files NOT Included (Upload Questions)

**Note**: The following USDOT questions are **upload** fields and not generated in scenarios:

- ❌ Driver's License Upload
- ❌ Client Identity Pictures Upload

**Reason**: These are file uploads, not data fields. The RPA agent would need actual files to upload, which is beyond scenario generation scope.

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Your ScenarioGenerator is COMPLETE!**

Every USDOT data field (79 total) has a corresponding scenario field with realistic data generation. The scenarios are ready for:

1. **Alex Training** - Train Alex to determine correct requirements
2. **USDOT RPA Training** - Train RPA to fill out forms correctly
3. **Compliance Testing** - Verify regulatory logic
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Test full application workflow

**No additional scenario fields need to be added!** 🎉
