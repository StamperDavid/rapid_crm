## Restoration Checklist

### When Restoring Jasper Agent:
1. ✅ **Kill all Node.js processes** to clear port conflicts
2. ✅ **Restore server.js** to use TrulyIntelligentAgent instead of EnterpriseAIService
3. ✅ **Fix voice endpoint** to use correct voice name casing ('Jasper' not 'jasper')
4. ✅ **Ensure port configuration** - Frontend on 3000, Backend on 3001
5. ✅ **Test voice synthesis** with Unreal Speech API
6. ✅ **Verify AI persona** is loaded from ai-identity.js
7. ✅ **Confirm persistent memory** is working
8. ✅ **Test AI awareness** of its capabilities and role

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check server status
netstat -ano | findstr ":300"

# Test voice synthesis
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/ai/unreal-speech" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"text":"Hello Boss! I am Jasper.","voiceId":"Jasper"}' -OutFile "test_voice.mp3"

# Start servers
npm run dev:full
```

## Key Differences from Other AI Services

### TrulyIntelligentAgent vs EnterpriseAIService
- **TrulyIntelligentAgent**: Has persistent memory, learns from conversations, maintains context
- **EnterpriseAIService**: More basic, no persistent memory, less intelligent

### Why TrulyIntelligentAgent is Better
1. **Persistent Memory**: Remembers previous conversations and learns
2. **Persona Awareness**: Fully understands its role and capabilities
3. **Adaptive Learning**: Improves over time through interactions
4. **Context Retention**: Maintains conversation context across sessions
5. **True Intelligence**: Uses reasoning rather than hardcoded patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Robotic Voice**: Check voice endpoint and API key
2. **Slow Responses**: Verify using TrulyIntelligentAgent, not EnterpriseAIService
3. **No Memory**: Ensure PersistentMemoryService is working
4. **Port Conflicts**: Kill all Node.js processes before restarting
5. **Voice API Errors**: Check voice name casing ('Jasper' not 'jasper')

### Quick Fixes
- **Voice Issues**: Use `/api/ai/unreal-speech` endpoint with voiceId: 'Jasper'
- **Memory Issues**: Restart server to reload TrulyIntelligentAgent
- **Port Issues**: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` then restart
- **Persona Issues**: Verify ai-identity.js is loaded correctly
