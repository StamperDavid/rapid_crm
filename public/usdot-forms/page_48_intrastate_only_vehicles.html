PAGE TITLE ROW HIDDEN:
Notice that the leafPageTitleTR has style="display: none;" - no visible page title.

DUAL TOOLTIPS:
This page has TWO separate tooltips in the question text:
1. "Commercial Motor Vehicles" - Full CMV definition (same as other pages)
2. "Intrastate" - NEW DEFINITION! Opposite of interstate

INTRASTATE DEFINITION (from tooltip):
"Transportation of passengers or property entirely within one State that is not part of a through movement that originates or terminates in another State or country."

KEY DISTINCTION:
"Solely in Intrastate Commerce" = ONLY within one state, no interstate operations
This is the OPPOSITE of Page 47 (Interstate only)

VEHICLE JURISDICTION BREAKDOWN (Pages 45-48):
- Page 45: Total vehicles by type and ownership (20 fields)
- Page 46: International operations (Canada/Mexico) - 2 fields
- Page 47: Vehicles operating SOLELY interstate - 1 field
- Page 48: Vehicles operating SOLELY intrastate - 1 field

These 4 pages comprehensively categorize ALL vehicles by:
1. Type (Straight Truck, Truck Tractor, Trailer, IEP)
2. Ownership (Owned, Term Leased, Trip Leased, Tow/Driveway, Serviced)
3. Geographic jurisdiction (Interstate only, Intrastate only, International)

FIELD DETAILS:
- Single numeric input
- maxlength="5", size="5", width="100px"
- aria-required="false" (optional field)

TOTAL FIELDS: 1 numeric input (optional)
