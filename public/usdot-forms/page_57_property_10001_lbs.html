CRITICAL INSURANCE THRESHOLD: 10,001 POUNDS

This is a MAJOR regulatory threshold for insurance requirements!

GVWR/GCWR >= 10,001 lbs determines:
1. Minimum Liability Insurance amounts
2. Cargo insurance requirements
3. Whether BMC-91 or BMC-91X filing applies

TYPICAL MINIMUM INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Vehicles < 10,001 lbs: Lower minimums or exempt
- Vehicles >= 10,001 lbs carrying general freight: $750,000 minimum
- Vehicles >= 10,001 lbs carrying hazmat: $1,000,000 - $5,000,000 depending on quantity

CONTEXTUAL QUESTION:
Notice the question references PREVIOUS ANSWERS:
"In the Operation Classification section of this application, you specified..."
- Property carrier (vs passengers)
- Interstate (vs intrastate)
- For Compensation (For-Hire vs Private)

The system is building context from earlier responses to ask relevant follow-up questions.

DUAL TOOLTIPS:
1. "Property" - Definition of property transportation
2. "Interstate" - NEW definition specifically for HAZMAT:
   "Transportation of ANY AMOUNT of hazardous material:
    (1) across State lines, including international boundaries; or
    (2) entirely within one State as part of a through movement..."
   
   Note: This is different from the CMV interstate definition - this is hazmat-specific!
