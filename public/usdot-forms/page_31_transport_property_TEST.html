<!-- METADATA -->
<!--
TEST FILE - FIELD IDs CHANGED TO VERIFY AGENT INTELLIGENCE

Original IDs:
- questionCode_B0051P050021S05002_Q05002_id_Y
- questionCode_B0051P050021S05002_Q05002_id_N

Test IDs (completely different):
- answer_yes_12345  
- answer_no_67890

The intelligent agent should still be able to:
1. Read the question: "Will the Applicant transport Property?"
2. Understand it's asking about property transportation
3. Check client data: operations.transportProperty
4. Find the "Yes" radio button by its label text
5. Fill it correctly

This proves the agent doesn't rely on field IDs!
