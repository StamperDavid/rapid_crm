TOOLTIP DEFINITION (with HTML <br/> tags):
Defines TWO types of passenger carriers:

1. PASSENGERS (BUSINESS) - Private Motor Carrier:
   - Interstate transportation of passengers
   - In furtherance of commercial enterprise
   - NOT available to public at large
   - Examples:
     * Companies using buses to transport employees (no fee)
     * Professional entertainers transporting themselves to performances
   - NOTE: Commercial businesses charging fees to general public are NOT private carriers

2. PASSENGERS (NON-BUSINESS) - Private Motor Carrier:
   - Interstate transportation of passengers
   - NOT in furtherance of commercial enterprise
   - NOT available to public at large
   - Examples: Church groups, non-profit organizations transporting members

PASSENGER CARRIER TYPES NOT COVERED BY "PRIVATE":
- For-Hire passenger carriers (charge fees to public)
- Charter bus services
- Public transit
- Taxi/rideshare services
These would be classified differently (For-Hire Passenger Carrier)

BRANCHING LOGIC:
- If "Yes": Leads to passenger carrier questions
  * Business vs Non-Business
  * Vehicle types (bus, van, etc.)
  * Seating capacity
  * For-Hire passenger authority if applicable
  
- If "No": Skips all passenger carrier questions

REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS:

PASSENGER CARRIERS have:
- Special safety requirements (vehicle inspections)
- Driver qualification requirements
- Different insurance minimums
- Passenger-specific Hours of Service rules
- Vehicle marking requirements

This tooltip is one of the most detailed, distinguishing between:
- For-Hire vs Private passenger carriers
- Business vs Non-Business private passenger carriers
- Public vs non-public availability

Critical for proper classification and regulatory compliance.
