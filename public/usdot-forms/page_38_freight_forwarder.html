DUAL DOCUMENTATION - TOOLTIP + EXTENDED DESCRIPTION:
This question has BOTH a tooltip (hover definition) AND extended description (always visible).
This provides comprehensive education about freight forwarders.

TOOLTIP DEFINITION (with HTML <br/> formatting):
"An entity that holds itself out to provide transportation of cargo belonging to others, using 
for-hire motor carriers subject to the commercial registration requirements to provide the actual 
interstate transportation. In the ordinary course of business, freight forwarders:
(1) assemble and consolidate shipments,
(2) conduct break bulk and distribution operations, and
(3) assume responsibility for transportation of property from place of receipt to the place of destination. 
Freight Forwarders may or may not operate vehicles."

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION (questionDescription):
"A freight forwarder is an entity that acts as a link between a shipper and the final point of 
distribution. A freight forwarder takes possession of the items being shipped and can arrange for 
various transportation services such as ocean shipping on cargo ships, road transport, and expedited 
shipping via air freight. The freight forwarder may or may not actually move the freight itself.

Please Note: A freight forwarder is not a motor carrier who hauls general freight for compensation."

FREIGHT FORWARDER KEY CHARACTERISTICS:

WHAT THEY DO:
1. Assemble and consolidate shipments (LTL consolidation)
2. Break bulk operations (split large shipments)
3. Distribution operations (route to multiple destinations)
4. ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY for cargo from pickup to delivery
5. Use authorized for-hire carriers for actual transportation
6. May arrange multi-modal transport (ocean, air, road, rail)
7. Take possession of cargo

MAY OR MAY NOT:
- Operate their own vehicles
- Provide actual transportation themselves
- Have trucks/drivers

CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:

FREIGHT FORWARDER vs BROKER:
- Freight Forwarder: ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY for cargo, takes possession
- Broker: Does NOT assume responsibility, only arranges

FREIGHT FORWARDER vs MOTOR CARRIER:
- Freight Forwarder: Focuses on consolidation/distribution, may not haul
- Motor Carrier: Focuses on hauling/transportation

Many freight forwarders are ALSO motor carriers (dual registration).

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IF YES:
- Freight Forwarder Operating Authority (FF Number)
- $75,000 surety bond or trust fund
- Process agent designation
- May also need USDOT Number if operating vehicles
- May also need MC Number if also acting as motor carrier

This is one of the most complex operation types to understand.
