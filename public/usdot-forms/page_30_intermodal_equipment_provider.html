    Intermodal equipment means trailing equipment that transports containers and consists mainly of 
    chassis, but may also include trailers. The IEP (or its agent) enters into a written interchange 
    agreement with a motor carrier (or its agent) or any other written document executed between the 
    IEP and a carrier. IEPs have contractual responsibility for marking their intermodal equipment 
    with its legal (or trade) name and USDOT Number, and systematically inspecting, repairing and 
    maintaining their intermodal equipment. An example of an IEP is someone who provides a container 
    chassis to move containers when they come off either a ship or rail. IEP may provide a chassis 
    to a motor carrier which will move the container or provide the chassis for the intermodal movement, 
    which the IEP will perform itself, with its own tractor.

TOOLTIP DEFINITION:
"Any person who interchanges intermodal equipment with a motor carrier pursuant to a written 
interchange agreement or has a contractual responsibility for the maintenance of the intermodal equipment."

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION (in questionDescription span):
Provides detailed explanation of:
- What intermodal equipment means (chassis, trailers)
- IEP responsibilities (written agreements, marking equipment with name/USDOT number, inspection/repair/maintenance)
- Example: Someone who provides container chassis for ship/rail containers
- IEP may provide chassis to motor carrier OR perform the movement themselves

This is the first actual question in the Operation Classification section.
The answer determines if IEP-specific questions will follow.

BRANCHING LOGIC:
- If "Yes": Likely leads to IEP-specific questions about equipment types, quantities, etc.
- If "No": Skips IEP questions, continues to next operation type question
