TOOLTIP DEFINITION:
"An entity that arranges for the interstate transportation of cargo belonging to others, using 
for-hire motor carriers subject to the commercial registration requirements to provide the actual 
transportation."

BROKER DEFINITION - KEY CHARACTERISTICS:

WHAT BROKERS DO:
- ARRANGE transportation (not perform it themselves)
- Act as intermediary between shippers and carriers
- Use authorized for-hire motor carriers to do actual hauling
- Cargo belongs to others (not broker's property)
- Interstate transportation only (intrastate brokers = different regulation)

WHAT BROKERS DO NOT DO:
- Do NOT assume responsibility for cargo
- Do NOT own/operate trucks (typically)
- Do NOT employ drivers (typically)
- Are NOT the actual motor carrier

BROKER TYPES:
1. Property Broker - General freight
2. Household Goods (HHG) Broker - Residential moves

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR BROKERS:

IF YES (Broker):
- Requires MC Number (Broker Authority) - NOT same as carrier MC Number
- Requires BMC-84 Broker Bond ($75,000)
- NO USDOT Number required (unless also operating as carrier)
- Subject to broker-specific regulations
- Must use registered/authorized motor carriers
- Cannot transport cargo themselves (unless separately registered as carrier)

IF NO (Not a Broker):
- Does not need Broker Authority
- May still need carrier authority if transporting

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
Many companies are BOTH:
- Broker (arranges transportation for others)
- Motor Carrier (transports own loads)
These need BOTH registrations (MC for carrier + MC for broker = different numbers)

This question determines if Broker Authority (MC Number for Brokerage) is required.
Completely different regulatory framework from motor carriers.

BRANCHING LOGIC:
- If "Yes": Leads to broker-specific questions
  * Bond information
  * Process agent designation
  * Broker contact information
  
- If "No": Skips broker questions
