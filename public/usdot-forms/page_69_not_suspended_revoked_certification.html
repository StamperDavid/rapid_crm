Form ID: form_B0161P160061
Branch: B016 (Compliance Certifications)
Page: P160061
Section: S16006
Question: Q16006
Progress: 90%

FIELD TYPE: Single checkbox (not radio!)

CERTIFICATION STATEMENT:
"Carrier is NOT prohibited from filing because FMCSA registration is:
  - Currently under suspension, OR
  - Was revoked less than 30 days before filing"

CRITICAL REGULATORY PROHIBITION - 30-DAY RULE:
After a revocation, carriers must wait AT LEAST 30 days before reapplying.

PROHIBITION SCENARIOS:
1. CURRENTLY UNDER SUSPENSION
   - Active suspension order in effect
   - Cannot register until suspension is lifted
   - May need to address violations first

2. REVOKED < 30 DAYS AGO
   - 30-day "cooling off" period
   - Prevents immediate reapplication after revocation
   - Gives FMCSA time to process enforcement actions
   - Prevents carriers from quickly creating new entities to evade safety oversight

ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY:
- 49 U.S.C. ยง 13905 - Registration authority
- 49 CFR ยง 385.13 - Administrative review procedures

PURPOSE OF 30-DAY RULE:
- Prevents "reincarnation" of unsafe carriers
- Allows enforcement database updates
- Provides time for safety investigations
- Discourages "DOT number churning"

CONSEQUENCES OF FALSE CERTIFICATION:
- Application denial
- Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1001
- Permanent bar from registration
- Potential prosecution

IF APPLICANT IS PROHIBITED:
- Must wait 30 days after revocation
- Must address underlying safety violations
- May need to file safety fitness challenge
- Could be subject to reincarnated carrier rules (49 CFR ยง 385.607)

VALIDATION:
- Checkbox must be checked to proceed
- System may cross-check against FMCSA enforcement database

NEXT BUTTON STATUS:
- Currently DISABLED (nextMenu_disabled class)
- Will enable when checkbox is checked
