TOOLTIP DEFINITION (with HTML <br/> formatting and numbered list):
"An entity that:
(1) manufactures, repairs, inspects, tests, qualifies, or maintains a cargo tank to ensure that 
    the cargo tank conforms to 49 CFR part 178, subpart J, and 49 CFR part 180, subpart E;
(2) alters the certificate of construction of cargo tank;
(3) ensures the continuing qualification of a cargo tank by performing a function prescribed in 
    49 CFR part 178 or 180; or
(4) makes any representation indicating compliance with one or more of the requirements of 
    49 CFR part 178 or 180."

CARGO TANK FACILITY - SPECIALIZED OPERATION TYPE:

NOT A CARRIER - This is a FACILITY/SERVICE PROVIDER, not a transportation company.

WHAT CARGO TANK FACILITIES DO:
1. MANUFACTURE cargo tanks
2. REPAIR cargo tanks
3. INSPECT cargo tanks
4. TEST cargo tanks
5. QUALIFY cargo tanks for compliance
6. MAINTAIN cargo tanks
7. ALTER certificates of construction
8. CERTIFY compliance with CFR regulations

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK:
- 49 CFR Part 178, Subpart J: Specifications for cargo tanks
- 49 CFR Part 180, Subpart E: Qualification and maintenance of cargo tanks

CARGO TANKS (what they work on):
- Tank trucks/trailers for hauling liquids/gases
- Hazardous materials tanks
- Petroleum product tanks
- Chemical tanks
- Bulk liquid/gas transport vessels

REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS IF YES:
- USDOT Number required for facility
- Must maintain records of all tank certifications
- Must have certified inspectors/testers
- Facility inspection requirements
- Different from motor carrier registration

EXAMPLES:
- Tank manufacturer (builds new cargo tanks)
- Tank repair shop (fixes damaged tanks)
- Inspection facility (annual tank testing)
- Certification agency (qualifies tanks for use)

This is a highly specialized, technical operation type.
Most applicants will answer "No" unless they specifically operate a tank facility.

IMPORTANT: This is NOT about:
- Operating tank trucks (that's motor carrier)
- Hauling hazmat (that's motor carrier with hazmat endorsement)
- Owning tanks (ownership alone doesn't require registration)

Only facilities that MANUFACTURE, REPAIR, INSPECT, TEST, or CERTIFY tanks need to register.
