<!-- METADATA -->
<!--
Form ID: form_B0161P160081
Branch: B016 (Compliance Certifications)
Page: P160081
Section: S16008
Question: Q16008
Progress: 90%

FIELD TYPE: Single checkbox (not radio!)

CONDITIONAL CERTIFICATION:
"IF registration is currently revoked, deficiencies have been corrected"

IMPORTANT: This is CONDITIONAL logic!
- The question starts with "If the Applicant's registration is currently revoked..."
- This means it applies ONLY to carriers with current revocations
- May be combined with Page 69's 30-day waiting period requirement

CONTEXT FROM PAGE 69:
Page 69 (Q16006) asked if carrier is NOT prohibited from filing because:
  - Registration currently under suspension, OR
  - Revoked < 30 days ago

This page (Q16008) addresses the scenario where:
  - Registration WAS revoked > 30 days ago (so 30-day period has passed)
  - Revocation may still be technically active
  - Carrier must certify deficiencies are CORRECTED to proceed

REVOCATION DEFICIENCIES COULD INCLUDE:
- Unsafe driving practices
- Inadequate driver qualification procedures
- Hours of service violations
- Vehicle maintenance failures
- Insurance lapses
- Drug/alcohol testing program failures
- Hazmat violations
- Failed safety audit
- Unfit safety rating

CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
Must demonstrate correction through:
1. Documentation of corrective actions
2. New safety management systems
3. Compliance with applicable regulations
4. Remediation of identified deficiencies
5. Possible safety audit or review

REGULATORY AUTHORITY:
- 49 CFR Part 385 - Safety Fitness Procedures
- 49 CFR § 385.13 - Administrative review
- 49 U.S.C. § 13905 - Registration requirements

CONDITIONAL LOGIC:
- IF never revoked → This certification may not apply (checkbox may be optional or auto-pass)
- IF revoked > 30 days ago → MUST certify deficiencies corrected
- IF revoked < 30 days ago → Cannot file (prohibited by Page 69/Q16006)

ENFORCEMENT:
- False certification = grounds for denial
- FMCSA may require proof of corrections before granting registration
- May trigger compliance review or safety audit
- Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1001

VALIDATION:
- Checkbox must be checked to proceed (if applicable)
- May trigger additional review by FMCSA safety staff

NEXT BUTTON STATUS:
- Currently DISABLED (nextMenu_disabled class)
- Will enable when checkbox is checked
