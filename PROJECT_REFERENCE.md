## üìù DETAILED BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

**Rapid Compliance** is a primarily AI-driven transportation compliance agency, comprised of several AI agents that help clients register and maintain the regulations required to own and operate a trucking company in the United States of America. 

**Business Model**: This business is essentially 98% automated and run by AI, requiring human oversight and in several different stages will require human interaction for MFA and other processes.

**Client Acquisition**: Clients will either learn of us through online searches or through our cold calling.

**Onboarding Process**: When a client comes to us online, it will be through our onboarding agent. This agent is responsible for:
- Conversationally collecting the information required to file a USDOT application for the client
- Making the client aware of the regulations required to operate
- Comparing the client answers to the qualified states list and the state and federal regulations
- Offering our services to file those regulations
- Collecting any payments required
- Saving the information to the new deal

**Customer Service**: At this point our customer service agent would take over the conversation and assist with any questions the client has or make any changes they want made, buy new products and services etc. The customer service agent and onboarding agent need to seem like one seamless agent to the client - the clients don't need to know there is more than one agent.

**Automation Flow**: Once all the information is saved to the account, the purchase of the registrations should fire automations to file the purchased registrations. For example, our first agent to be created after the onboarding and customer service agents will be the USDOT RPA agent - this agent will file the USDOT application and authority for the client.

**Agent Builder**: We will need to create a specific agent and training environment for each registration going forward, which is why we have an agent builder onboard.

### Lead vs Deal Classification:
- **Lead**: Client gives minimal contact info and desires, no service provided
- **Deal**: Client gets ANY service (even free USDOT number) = deal created

## ü§ñ AGENT ARCHITECTURE

### Client-Facing Agents (Appear as ONE agent to clients):
- **Onboarding Agent**: Handles initial client interaction and information collection
- **Customer Service Agent**: Takes over after onboarding for ongoing support
- **Unified Experience**: Both agents use same voice/persona - client thinks it's one agent
- **Seamless Transition**: No visible handoff between agents

### Specialized Registration Agents (Created via Agent Builder):
- **USDOT RPA Agent**: Files USDOT applications and authority (FIRST to be created)
- **MC Number Agent**: Files MC Number applications
- **State Registration Agent**: Files state-specific registrations
- **IFTA Agent**: Files IFTA and fuel tax compliance
- **Additional Agents**: Created as needed for each registration type

### Agent Builder:
- **Purpose**: Create specific agents and training environments for each registration
- **Process**: Build agent ‚Üí Create training environment ‚Üí Train to 100% accuracy ‚Üí Deploy

### Automation Flow:
1. **Information Saved**: Once client information is saved to account
2. **Purchase Triggers**: Purchase of registrations fires automations
3. **Agent Deployment**: Appropriate specialized agent files the purchased registration
4. **Human Intervention**: Only for MFA and other security processes
